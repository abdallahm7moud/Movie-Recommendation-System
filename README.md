# MovieLens Recommender Dashboard

This is an interactive movie recommendation dashboard built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and powered by collaborative filtering and content-based models. It offers personalized movie recommendations, item similarity browsing, and interactive UI features such as watch history logging and theming support.

## Features

### User Page

- **User Selection**: Choose a user from the MovieLens dataset.
- **Watch History View**: Displays the selected user's past watched movies with TMDB-enhanced visuals and metadata.
- **Number of Recommendations Input**: Control how many top-N movies to recommend.
- **Top-N Recommendations**: Returns a ranked list of personalized recommendations for the selected user.
- **Recommendation Pagination**: Navigate through the list of recommendations using offset paging logic.
- **Mark as Watched**: Adds a movie to the userâ€™s watch history interactively.

### Item Page

- **Movie Selection**: Choose any movie from the dataset.
- **Movie Profile View**: Shows movie title, genres, and enriched details from TMDB (e.g., poster, overview).
- **Top-N Similar Movies**: Displays the most similar movies to the selected one based on genre similarity.
- **Similarity Navigation**: Move forward/backward across pages of similar movies using offset.

## Recommender Models

### User Recommender

- Uses the `SVD` algorithm from the [Surprise](https://surpriselib.com/) library.
- Predicts ratings for unseen movies based on matrix factorization.
- The trained model is loaded and used in real-time to serve top-N personalized recommendations.

### Item Similarity

- Applies `TfidfVectorizer` on genre metadata to generate feature vectors.
- Uses `cosine_similarity` to compute similarity scores between movies.
- Similar items are retrieved dynamically on user selection.

## TMDB Integration

This project uses the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) to fetch:

- Movie posters
- Overviews and additional metadata
- Optional: Used for both recommendation and history sections to improve visual appeal

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [MovieLens Small Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- **Size**: ~100,000 ratings across ~9000 movies
- Used primarily for collaborative filtering (ratings matrix) and content-based filtering (genres).
